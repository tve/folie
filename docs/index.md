# Forth Live Explorer

**Folie** is work-in-progress. For a first introduction see these articles:

* [A new serial tool: vive la Folie!](http://jeelabs.org/article/1613b/) - on
  the JeeLabs weblog, Mar 2016  
  (a translated and adapted version of the above was also published in the Q4
  edition of "Vierte Dimension" in German - [forth-ev.de](http://forth-ev.de))
* [This node speaks Forth (and C)](http://jeelabs.org/article/1651c/) - on the
  JeeLabs weblog, Dec 2016

The first version of Folie is part of the [Embello](http://embello.jeelabs.org)
project, and can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jeelabs/embello/tree/master/tools/folie), see the
[README](https://github.com/jeelabs/embello/blob/master/tools/folie/README.md).

Folie v2 is a complete rewrite, with as goal to better support all platforms and
to simplify uploads with built-in flash images for a few µC boards.

There are a number of ready-made executables on the
[Releases](https://github.com/jeelabs/folie/releases) page. There are no
dependencies, they'll also run on older versions of each OS.
