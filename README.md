The **Forth Live Explorer** is a command-line utility to talk to a
micro-controller via a (local or remote) serial port. Its main mode of operation
is as interactive terminal, but it can also upload code to an STM32 ÂµC and is
tailored in particular for use with [Mecrisp
Forth](http://mecrisp.sourceforge.net/).

This is experimental code, the stable version is at:
